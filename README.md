This project simulates a 2D rocket launch with adjustable parameters, enabling users to experiment with the physics of launching a rocket. The simulation includes effects like gravity, atmospheric drag, and turbulence, making it a challenging and realistic experience.

Features
Customizable Launch Parameters: Users can set thrust, burn time, launch angle, gravity strength, rocket mass, drag coefficient, air density, and atmosphere scale height.
Realistic Physics: Simulates gravitational pull, atmospheric drag, and turbulence for added difficulty.
Dynamic Visuals: Features a starry background, a planet with atmosphere, and an adjustable rocket that reacts to user-defined conditions.

Upon running the simulator, you’ll see input fields to customize the rocket’s launch parameters:

Enter Values: Click on an input box to activate it, type in the desired value, and press Enter or Launch.
Launch the Rocket: Press the Launch button to start the simulation with the specified parameters.
Parameters
Thrust (N): The force applied to propel the rocket. Higher values increase acceleration.
Burn Time (s): Duration of the rocket’s fuel burn.
Launch Angle: Angle (in degrees) of the launch relative to the ground.
Gravity Strength: Strength of the planet’s gravity.
Rocket Mass (kg): The weight of the rocket. Heavier rockets are harder to launch.
Drag Coefficient: A measure of air resistance; higher values increase drag.
Air Density: Density of the atmosphere; affects drag.
Atmosphere Scale Height: Defines how quickly air density decreases with altitude.
Simulation Tips
Balancing Thrust and Mass: Ensure the thrust is high enough to overcome gravity and mass.
Adjusting for Drag: Higher drag values require higher thrust or a lower launch angle for effective escape.
Turbulence Effects: In some simulations, slight random turbulence may affect the rocket’s flight path.
